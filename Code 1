A scholar and a soldier, he has promised reconciliation and reform. To cleanse the spoils system and to guide the Union into a new age of honest governance.<br><br> But his victory has not silenced division. The Republican Party remains a house divided. Stalwarts and Half-Breeds, machine and reform, each pulling at the seams of Garfield’s coalition. While the specter of Reconstruction still roars and rages beneath the surface.<br><br> Now, as 1881 arrives, President Garfield must prove that compromise can defeat division, that unity shall stand strong, and that the promise of a united America did not die upon the fields of Chickamauga.",

Garfield has arisen to the Presidency with an increasingly shrinking Republican majority.
